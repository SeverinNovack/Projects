# Witch Table with OpenGL
The task for this project was to create a scene where an object consisting out of multiple different parts is moving in a rectangular. The object should also have parts that are moving for example a flying bird with moving wings.  
I choose to create a witch table with multiple objects on it. One object for example is a book that turns its own page every few seconds.  
I've also included two candles that have a lighting effect on the scene.  
As the moving object I created a little mouse that is walking on the table and jumping over the before mentioned book. The head and tail of the mouse are moving the whole time.  
You are also able to move the mouse around with w, a, s, d and resets its position with r.
