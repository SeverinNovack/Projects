# Kersti - An android app
Kersti is a prototype of an app that is targeted at study beginners.  
The name Kersti is an acronym for "Kennenlernen" and "Ersti" which translates to "to get to know" and "freshman".  
The app is targeted at freshman that have no prior contacts to any of their fellow students and to students that have trouble getting to know people with the same interests as them.  
You sign up and choose your interests out of a list. An algorithm then matches you with fellow students with similiar interests and you can add them to your friendlist. If they accepts your request you can start chatting with each other.  
You have a profile with a profile picture and the list of your interests.
