# A pizza-service website
The task for this website was to create a pizza-service where a customer can order a pizza and can monitor how far the process of his order is.  
We should also include a website for the baker and driver to input their status. A pizza on the driver site should only appear if the baker has finished the whole order.  
The site where the customer can monitor the state of his order should always show the newest state and should refresh itself without the need of refreshing the whole site. This is implemented via AJAX.
