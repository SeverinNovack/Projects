# Tic Tac Toe in Prolog
The task for this project was to create an expert system in Prolog.  
I decided to test how fitting Prolog is to implement an unbeatable AI for Tic Tac Toe.  
You can start the game with the input "start." and choose whether you want to play versus the AI or against another player. The second option was a request from my lecturer.  
The AI is undefeatable.
